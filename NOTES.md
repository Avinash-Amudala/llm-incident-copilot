## Week 1: Initial Setup

### Day 1 (2026-01-27)

**What I changed:**
- Created the complete project skeleton with FastAPI backend and React frontend
- Set up Docker Compose with 4 services: Qdrant (vector DB), Ollama (LLM), Backend, Frontend
- Implemented log chunking with configurable chunk size and overlap
- Added 3 sample incident scenarios for demo

**Why it matters:**
- End-to-end skeleton means I can now iterate on individual components
- Docker Compose ensures anyone can run the entire stack with one command
- Sample data enables immediate demo without setup friction

**What failed:**
- (Track challenges here as you work)

**What I learned:**

**What I'll do next:**
- [ ] Test the full Docker Compose stack
